This code is the implementation of IHGC-GAN.

IHGC-GAN: Influence hypergraph convolutional generative adversarial network for disease risk prediction.

The experiment data can be downloaded in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Department of Defense ADNI (ADNIDOD) datasets. During the experiment, the order of code use is the same as the label.
